# Roadmap for Developing a Chess Engine and Application

This document outlines the roadmap for building a custom chess engine in Rust and integrating it into a full-stack application using Rust (backend) and React.js (frontend). The chosen stack and tools are designed for simplicity, performance, and scalability.

---

## Phase 1: Planning

### Core Decisions
- **Backend Framework**: Axum (modern, async, and modular).
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js (popular and feature-rich for UIs).
- **Chess Engine Representation**: Bitboard approach (efficient and fast).
- **Frontend State Management**: React Context API (simpler than Redux).
- **API Communication**: REST (simpler and widely supported).

### Overall Structure
- **Backend**:
  - Chess engine logic implemented in Rust.
  - RESTful APIs for game interactions and analysis.
- **Frontend**:
  - Interactive chessboard UI using `react-chessboard`.
  - API-driven UI for single-player, multiplayer, and game analysis.

---

## Phase 2: Core Chess Engine Development

### Chessboard Representation
- Use bitboards for efficient move generation and board state management:
  ```rust
  struct ChessBoard {
      white_pawns: u64,
      black_pawns: u64,
      white_knights: u64,
      black_knights: u64,
      // Other pieces...
  }
  ```

### Move Generation
- Implement pseudo-legal move generation for all pieces.
- Handle special moves: castling, en passant, and promotions.

### Move Validation
- Ensure moves are legal:
  - No move leaves the king in check.
  - Use bitwise operations for efficient threat detection.

### Evaluation Function
- Define basic heuristics for evaluating board positions:
  - Material balance.
  - Piece positioning.
  - Pawn structure.

### Search Algorithm
- Implement Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning:
  ```rust
  fn minimax(position: &ChessBoard, depth: u32, alpha: i32, beta: i32) -> i32 {
      if depth == 0 {
          return evaluate(position);
      }
      // Implement recursive search logic
  }
  ```

### Game State Management
- Track:
  - Board state.
  - Move history.
  - Turn, castling rights, and en passant.

---

## Phase 3: Backend Development

### Set Up Axum
- Create a new Rust project:
  ```bash
  cargo new chess-backend
  cd chess-backend
  cargo add axum tokio serde serde_json
  ```
- Set up Axum for routing and request handling:
  ```rust
  use axum::{Router, routing::post};
  use serde::Deserialize;

  #[derive(Deserialize)]
  struct MoveRequest {
      fen: String,
      mv: String,
  }

  async fn make_move(req: axum::Json<MoveRequest>) -> String {
      let new_fen = apply_move(&req.fen, &req.mv);
      new_fen
  }

  fn main() {
      let app = Router::new().route("/move", post(make_move));
      axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:8080".parse().unwrap())
          .serve(app.into_make_service())
          .await
          .unwrap();
  }
  ```

### Integrate Chess Engine
- Implement move validation, FEN parsing, and position evaluation directly in the backend.

### API Endpoints
- `/move`: Validate and apply a move, return the new FEN.
- `/evaluate`: Analyze a position and return evaluation scores.
- `/new-game`: Start a new game.

---

## Phase 4: Frontend Development

### Set Up React
- Create the React project:
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app chess-frontend
  cd chess-frontend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install react-chessboard axios
  ```

### Chessboard UI
- Use `react-chessboard` to render the board and handle interactions:
  ```javascript
  import Chessboard from "react-chessboard";

  const Game = () => {
    const [gameState, setGameState] = useState("start");

    const onMove = (move) => {
      // Call backend API for move validation and update game state
    };

    return <Chessboard position={gameState} onPieceDrop={onMove} />;
  };

  export default Game;
  ```

### API Integration
- Use Axios for communicating with the backend:
  ```javascript
  const makeMove = async (fen, move) => {
    const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:8080/move", { fen, move });
    return response.data; // New FEN
  };
  ```

### State Management
- Use React Context API to manage global game state.

---

## Phase 5: Hybrid Workflow Integration

### Frontend Local Evaluation
- Add a simple local evaluation function for instant feedback.
- Use the backend for deeper analysis on demand.

### Backend Optimization
- Optimize the chess engine for faster performance with threading or caching.

---

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### Frontend
- Add animations for piece movement.
- Implement a timer and player information panel.

### Backend
- Add multiplayer support using WebSockets.
- Use a database (SQLite/Postgres) to store game history and user accounts.

---

## Phase 7: Deployment

### Frontend
- Build and deploy the React app:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- Host on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

### Backend
- Build the Rust backend:
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```
- Containerize using Docker and deploy to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).

---

## Phase 8: Testing and Optimization

### Testing
- Unit test the chess engine (move generation, validation).
- Integration test backend APIs and frontend interactions.

### Optimization
- Profile and optimize backend performance.
- Minify and optimize frontend assets.

---

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building and integrating a custom chess engine into a full-stack application. Tackle each phase iteratively to ensure consistent progress.
